### Explanation of Lab 0: Getting Started with Programming in Python

Lab 0 serves as an introduction to Python programming, helping you get acquainted with the tools and environment you’ll use throughout the course. The primary goal is to set up the software, specifically PyCharm, and install important Python libraries for machine learning and data science. Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

---

#### **Task 0: Software Setup**
1. **Install ThinLinc**: If you're working on-campus, ThinLinc is pre-installed on lab computers. If you're working remotely, you’ll need to install ThinLinc from [this link](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download) to connect to your university's servers.
2. **Install PyCharm**: Download and install PyCharm (you may use other IDEs, but only one per lab group).
3. **Set up a New Project in PyCharm**:
    - Open PyCharm, create a new project, and choose the directory where you'd like to store your project files.
4. **Install Required Libraries**:
    - Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in PyCharm’s terminal. The `requirements.txt` file will list the necessary libraries for machine learning and data analysis, which includes:
      - **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
      - **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
      - **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning models.
      - **Scipy**: For scientific and mathematical computations.
      - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

    Optional packages:
    - **TensorFlow & Keras**: For deep learning.
    - **PyTorch**: Another framework for deep learning.

#### **Task 1: Creating a New Python Script**

1. **Create a Python File**:
   - In PyCharm, create a new Python file by either clicking `File -> New -> Python File` or right-clicking the folder and selecting `New -> Python File`.

2. **Write a Basic Program**:
   - Start by writing a simple print statement in the Python script:

   ```python
   print("Hello, welcome to Python programming!")
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Run the program by pressing `Shift+F10` or by clicking the Run button at the top right.

---

#### **Task 2: Upgrading the Script**

1. **Write a Simple Function**:
   - Extend the script by writing a function that prints your favorite food. Here’s an example:

   ```python
   # Function that prints favorite food
   def print_favorite_food():
       print("My favorite food is pizza!")

   # Call the function
   print_favorite_food()
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   - After adding the function, run the script again to see the updated output.

3. **Understand the Print Differences**:
   - The first print function simply outputs a string, while the second demonstrates a function that encapsulates logic and can be reused throughout the code.

---

#### **Task 3: Linear Model Example**

1. **Load and Run the Linear Model Example**:
   - You are provided with a file `Lab0_test.py`, which includes an example of a linear model. Load this file into your PyCharm project and run it.
   
2. **Analyze the Output**:
   - This script is meant to give you a sneak peek of the machine learning models you'll be working with in later labs. Focus on understanding the output and try to familiarize yourself with any new concepts it introduces.

### Sample Code for Lab 0

Below is a sample Python script that combines both **Task 1** and **Task 2**.

```python
# Task 1: Basic print statement
print("Hello, welcome to Python programming!")

# Task 2: Function that prints favorite food
def print_favorite_food():
    print("My favorite food is pizza!")

# Calling the function
print_favorite_food()
```

This script helps you understand basic Python syntax, including defining and calling functions.

### Conclusion

The goal of **Lab 0** is to familiarize yourself with the tools (PyCharm) and libraries (Numpy, Pandas, etc.) that will be essential in future labs. It is a preparatory step for getting comfortable with Python, the IDE, and the machine learning libraries that you'll use throughout the course. Once you've completed this, you’ll be ready to move on to more advanced labs.
